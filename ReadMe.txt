A web project created using C#, .NET, TypeScript, Angular, MySQL and a variety of third-party libraries including ngx-bootstrap.
This is a dating website where users can register/log into accounts, and search for matches based on their own filters.
They can like other users and send messages to them, and also customise their own profiles, 
from their text descriptions to their profile photos.

This was inspired by the Udemy course by Neil Cummings: https://www.udemy.com/course/build-an-app-with-aspnet-core-and-angular-from-scratch/
Despite being a course, there were numerous challenges in directly updating it, and configuring it for present tech. It was far
from a direct copy, and I found myself regularly doing my own research to supplement what I had learned in the course.

The purpose of this project was to learn the extent of the .NET Core and Angular frameworks, and see the effectiveness of 
combining the two. The end result is what you can download here and test in a .net runtime environment, 
either by uploading to a server or running on your local machine.
With the understanding I took away from this, I feel confident in programming .NET and Angular for future applications
